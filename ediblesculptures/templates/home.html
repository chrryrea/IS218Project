          <h3>Samantha Fox</h3>
          <p>A talented 32-year-old artist based in Long Beach Island, New Jersey. Originally pursuing a degree in psychology, Samantha never expected that a college pottery class would spark a lifelong passion. What started as a hobby quickly turned into a full-time artistic journey, with her unique ceramic pieces now gaining recognition across the local art scene. Inspired by the ocean views from her home on the bay, her work blends natural textures with modern design. When she's not in her studio shaping clay, Samantha enjoys spending time with her-two children, exploring the shore, and finding new ways to bring creativity into everyday life.

          <h3>Jacob Sullivan</h3>
          <p>Jacob Sullivan is a contemporary sculptor known for his ability to transform everyday organic forms into timeless works of art. Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, he draws
              inspiration from nature, using materials like bronze and ceramic to capture the delicate balance between realism and abstraction. His renowned Pair of Pears series explores themes of duality, imperfection, and harmony, with each piece showcasing meticulous attention to texture and form. A graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, Sullivan has exhibited his work in galleries across the U.S. and Europe, earning recognition for his understated yet evocative style.</p>
